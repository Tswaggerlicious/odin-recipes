        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First dissolve the <strong>dashi powder</strong> in the <strong>water</strong> and combine it with the <strong>flour, egg, salt</strong> and <strong>sugar</strong> until you have a homogenous dough.</li>
            <li>In the meantime peel the <strong>ginger</strong> and cut it into thin pieces. Marinate it together with the <strong>vinegar</strong> and <strong>sugar</strong> in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Cut the <strong>cabbage</strong> into thin slices and chop it into small pieces. Afterwards cut the green part of the <strong>spring onion</strong> into fine rings and the <strong>bacon</strong> into 3-4cm big chunks.</li>
            <li>Mix everything that you cut exept for the bacon into the dough.</li>
            <li>Take a fairly wide pan and add the <strong>oil</strong> to it. Now add the dough into the pan and form it into one big pancake. It should be around 2cm high.</li>
            <li>Add the <strong>bacon</strong> like shingles onto the pancake. When the first side is brown, flip the pancake onto the other side using two spatulas. Cook for another 3-5min until golden brown. Flip it again.</li>
            <li>Now add the <strong>okonomiyaki sauce</strong> and spread it on the surface. You can add the <strong>nori powder, kewpie mayo</strong> and <strong>bonito flakes</strong> to your liking.</li>
            <li><em>Enjoy!</em></li>
