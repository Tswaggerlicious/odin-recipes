        <h3 class="header third">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="list" id="ingredients">
            <li>8 slices of toast bread</li>
            <li>margarine</li>
            <li>4 slices of cheese</li>
            <li class="end">Ketchup</li>
        </ul>


        <h3 class="header third">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>First you spread <strong>margarine</strong> on one side of every <strong>slice of toast bread</strong>.</li>
            <li>Give half of the slices with the margarine first into a frying pan. Then place on each slice a <strong>slice of cheese</strong>.</li>
            <li>Now put the other slices of toast bread onto the sandwich, with the margarine facing up.</li>
            <li>When the one side of the sandwich is brown, flip to the other side. The cheese should start melting by then and keep both slices of toast bread together.</li>
            <li>When both sides are brown, serve the grilled cheese sandwiches with some <strong>ketchup</strong> to dip in.</li>
            <li><em>Enjoy!</em></li>
