            <li>First you spread <strong>margarine</strong> on one side of every <strong>slice of toast bread</strong>.</li>
            <li>Give half of the slices with the margarine first into a frying pan. Then place on each slice a <strong>slice of cheese</strong>.</li>
            <li>Now put the other slices of toast bread onto the sandwich, with the margarine facing up.</li>
